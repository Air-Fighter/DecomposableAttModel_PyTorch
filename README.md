# DecomposableAttModel_PyTorch

Rebuild the model in paper [A Decomposable Attention Model for Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01933.pdf).
However, the activation function has been changed to SELU and the optimizing algrithm is Adadelta.

The project is based on the [snli example project from PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/snli).

## Requirement
1. PyTorch
2. torchtext
